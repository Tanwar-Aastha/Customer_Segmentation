### What is a Customer Dispute?
A **customer dispute** occurs when a consumer disagrees with a business regarding a product, service, or transaction. These disputes may arise due to billing errors, unsatisfactory services, product defects, or unfulfilled promises. If unresolved, disputes can escalate into complaints, negative reviews, or even legal action.
