Closed with monetary relief (~25K) is significantly less frequent, showing that financial compensation is rare. Closed without relief (~15K) and Closed (~10K) occur less often, while Closed with relief has the lowest count (~5K), indicating that direct consumer benefits are rare suggesting a preference for explanations over actual remediation.

In contrast, when a timely response is given, disputes drop to around 40%, with the remaining 60% of complaints being resolved without a dispute. This indicates that timely responses can cut disputes by more than half, significantly improving customer satisfaction and reducing escalations. However, some disputes still occur despite prompt responses, suggesting that factors beyond response time such as resolution quality and issue complexity also play a role.")

Initially, complaints were below 2,000, but they surged rapidly, crossing 4,000 by mid-2012 and continuing to rise. The fluctuations between 2013 and 2015 indicate periodic increases and decreases, likely influenced by external factors such as policy changes or service quality variations. However, there is a sharp decline after mid-2016, with complaints dropping drastically to near zero. This sudden drop suggests a possible change in reporting mechanisms, data availability issues, or significant business improvements that reduced complaints.")
